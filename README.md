# CodeAlpha Internship: Cloud Computing & Security Projects

This repository documents the tasks and projects completed during my Cloud Computing Internship at CodeAlpha. The focus of these projects is on cloud architecture, data security, and backend integration.

## Project Overview

### 1. Data Integrity & Redundancy System
* **Directory:** `/Task_DataRedundancy`
* **Description:** An automated system designed to maintain dataset quality. It scans incoming data streams against existing records to identify and eliminate duplicate entries, ensuring storage optimization and data consistency.

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention & Secure Backend
* **Directory:** `/Task_SqlInjection`
* **Description:** A security-focused backend implementation. This task demonstrates how to harden database interactions using **Prepared Statements** to block SQL injection attacks. Additionally, it implements **AES-256 encryption** to secure sensitive data before storage.

### 3. Cloud-Integrated Chatbot
* **Directory:** `/Task_Chatbot`
* **Description:** A lightweight, rule-based chatbot deployed on the cloud. It features a minimal frontend interface communicating with a backend service to handle user queries efficiently.
